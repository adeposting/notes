This page is a central directory of generic prompts for generating software projects in various languages using AI agents.

This page will be updated over time with more prompts as I write or find them.

**The list of prompts so far...**

* [AI Agent Prompt for Python Software Project Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-agent-prompt-for-python-software-project-generation) *A generic prompt for generating an entire Python software projects using AI agents.*

(Ok, yes, the list so far only has one prompt, but if you bookmark this page and come back later I will be adding more over time.)

These prompts are optimized over time, for the latest version go to the [github.com/adeposting/prompts](https://github.com/adeposting/prompts) repository.

I also maintain a central directory of [AI Prompts for Code Snippet Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-prompts-for-code-snippet-generation) with generic prompts for generating individual code snippets in various languages.

All prompts are less 8000 characters, in order to fit the maximum prompt length of [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com).

**A GitHub repository with all of my prompts:**

All of my prompts are available at the GitHub repository:

[github.com/adeposting/prompts](https://github.com/adeposting/prompts)

There are prompts for various tasks, including generating code snippets in multiple programming languages, agent prompts for generating entire software projects, etc.

**Other articles on prompts for code snippet and software project generation:**

I maintain other central directories with links to AI prompts for various tasks:
