This page is a central directory of my cheatsheets of one-liner CLI commands.

* [Git and Github CLI One-Liners Cheatsheet](https://adeposting.com/git-and-github-cli-one-liners-cheatsheet) *Useful `git` and `gh` (GitHub CLI) commands.*
* [ffmpeg CLI One-Liners Cheatsheet](https://adeposting.com/ffmpeg-cli-one-liners-cheatsheet) *`ffmpeg` CLI commands for manipulating, converting, and editing video and audio in various formats.*

If you bookmark this page and come back later I'll be updating this page over time as more are added.
