This page is a central directory of generic prompts for generating code snippets in various languages using AI.

This page will be updated over time with more prompts as I write or find them.

**The list of prompts so far...**

* [AI Prompt for C++ Code Snippet Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-prompt-for-c++-code-snippet-generation)
* [AI Prompt for Node.js Code Snippet Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-prompt-for-nodejs-code-snippet-generation)
* [AI Prompt for Java Code Snippet Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-prompt-for-java-code-snippet-generation)
* [AI Prompt for Python Code Snippet Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-prompt-for-python-code-snippet-generation)
* [AI Prompt for Rust Code Snippet Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-prompt-for-rust-code-snippet-generation)

The list is small so far, but if you bookmark this page and come back later I will be adding more over time.

These prompts are optimized over time, for the latest version go to the [github.com/adeposting/prompts](https://github.com/adeposting/prompts) repository.

I also maintain a central directory of [AI Agent Prompts for Software Project Generation](https://adeposting.com/ai-agent-prompts-for-software-project-generation) with generic prompts for generating software projects in various languages using AI agents.

All prompts are less 8000 characters, in order to fit the maximum prompt length of [Chat GPT](https://chatgpt.com).

**A GitHub repository with all of my prompts:**

All of my prompts are available at the GitHub repository:

[github.com/adeposting/prompts](https://github.com/adeposting/prompts)

There are prompts for various tasks, including generating code snippets in multiple programming languages, agent prompts for generating entire software projects, etc.
