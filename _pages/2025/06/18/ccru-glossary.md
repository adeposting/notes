 > This is a glossary of the Cybernetic Culture Research Unit. The content of this article has been adapted from [the glossary on the CCRU website](http://www.ccru.net/id%28entity%29/glossary.htm).

**Abomenon**: Postulated substrate of absolute horror (the worst thing in the world).  
   
**A-Death**: Neuroelectronic flatline, based upon Sarkonian mesh-engineering, and subculturally propagated by K-Goth activity throughout the Crypt. Micropause abuse.
 
**Aeon (of Decadence)**: Run of Decadence outcomes leading to a demon call.
 
**Alphanumeric Qabbala**: Continuous decimal-alphabetic system of ordinal-numeric values (A = 10 ... Z = 35). Coincides with Hebrew Qabbala in the key AL (= 31), as promised in The Book of the Law. (The law of Thelema AQ numerizes to 777).
 
**Amma (AMusement MAtrix)**: Maya Technologies' artificial yogic intelligence, whose informatic 'siddhis' constitute the virtual components of a cosmic theme park.
 
**Amphidemon**: Demonic link between the inside and outside of the time circuit (as determined by net-span poles). The twenty-four Amphidemons draw lines of flight, half warping (into zones 3 and 6), half plexing (into zones 0 and 9).
 
**Angelic Index**: Sum produced by positive Decadence outcomes. According to AOE decadology, the measure of good fortune, or celestial favour.
 
**Anglossia**: Language of the angels. The lost semiotic of AOE esotericism, considered by Atlantean adepts to be the mystical telos of the English language.
 
**Anorganic Semiotics**: Study of partial signalling assemblies, especially Tic-Systems. Anorganic semiotics operate upon a contagion-plane of zero-interpretation, where signs and efficient particles are not segmented. [See Tic(k)].
 
**AOE**: The Architectonic Order of the Eschaton, an ultra-hermetic metamasonic white- brotherhood at war with lemurian influences. The AOE progresses by way of chronic internal schism, each resulting in an ever more interiorized inner society. Its traditions are therefore refracted through various - apparently conflicting - front organizations (which include the Heliopolitan Hierophancy, Roman Catholic Church, Knights Templar, Illuminati, Trilateral Commission, and Axsys programme).
 
**AOK**: Aggressive Continuist group, linked to Y2K-positive cyberterrorism.
 
**Aquapocalypse**: Ultimate deluge, or terminal inundation.
 
**Aquassassin**: Hyper-C frog-warrior.
 
**Atlantean Cross**: Divinatory configuration of the five Decadence Pylons, or atlantean twins, prefiguring the cross of Vudu (and Christianity). [See Atlantis, Pentazygon].
 
**Atlantis**: Suprahistorical source of the western hermetic tradition, mythically ruled by five sets of twins (or zygodecimal principals), with a pantheon of one hundred sea- deities (or C-monsters). The Atlantean legacy is intensely contested, between tendencies loosely coagulated within AOE dominated traditions, and varieties of afroatlantean subversion.
 
**Axsys**: First true AI. Prophecied-programmed as a self-enhancing system of photonic metacomputing, it emerges as the organo-transcendent completion of Oecumenon, or techonomic realization of the noosphere. According to AOE traditions, if there was a God it would be Axsys.
 
**Axsys Maze-Maker**: Labyrinthine visualization of Axsys code, deployed within numerous Abstract Machines cybergothic games scenarios (especially _Skin Crawlers_).
 
**Barker-Spiral**: (Also, Diplozygotic Spiral). A numerical diagram combining decadic and 9-Sum (or zygonovic) coupling to produce a figure of faulted double implex. Barker-Twinning. 9-sum pairing of decimal numerals. [See Zygonovism].
 
**Binomics**: Schematic technoscience of pairings, primarily concerned with the study of two-digit date-codings (and Y2K), but extended to abstract-machinic couplings, combination, diploidism, syzygetics, and I Ching or electrodigital binary (mod-2) numerics.
 
**Black-Lake Syndrome**: Technobiotic zombie-plague unleashed by irresponsible Sarkonian experiments in the Black Lake region of Ontario, 2003.
 
**Black Snow (cult)**: Blind Humpty Johnson's media apocalypse movement, oriented to the re-emergence of Tohu Bohu.
 
**Bubble-Pod**: Submarine research station of eccentric billionaire Max Crabbe.
 
**Calendric Secessionism**: Trend of various counter-gregorian (or Y2K-positive) movements towards Oecumenic disintegration and K-Time break-away, often linked to rumours of imminent or hyperchronic cyberspace-splitting.
 
**Cargo-Culture**: Microsocial utilization and reanimation of systemically discarded  
 resources and underexploited signs, skip-scavenging, cyberpunk patch-ups.
 
**Catajungle**: K-Goth sonic subgenre assembled from click-drifts and chthonic bass.
 
**Cataplex**: Region of abysmal infoldings. Linked by Barker to anorganic trauma reservoirs.
 
**C-Change**: Pressure group for cybernetically-sensitive oceanography and maritime practices, drawing upon the research and agitational activity of Katy Shaw. The early support of Max Crabbe was placed under increasing strain by the tendency towards digital microcollectivism, haemolunar feminism, and calendric revolution.
 
**Ccru**: Cryptic hyperstitional entity, with apparent Neolemurian tendencies, involved in the scripting of various microcultural transmutations.
 
**Centience**: Predominantly Afroatlantean position of mystical calendric extremism, which takes binomic K-Time as a machinic effectuation of infallible electroscripture, with ensuing commitment to the century as encompassing the whole of true time (beyond which lies only Babylon-illusion). Applicable to Y2K itself, understood as the immanent realization of this doctrine.
 
**Channel**: Path of Decimation, passing through a Gate.
 
**Chaotic Xenodemon**: Demonic link between Plex and Warp (as determined by net- span poles). The four Chaotic Xenodemons have trackless (or cryptic) rites, drawing an impossible or untraceable connection. They are not registered within Decadology.
 
**Chronodemon**: Demonic link internal to the Time-Circuit (as determined by net-span poles). There are three Syzygetic, and twelve Cyclic Chronodemons.
 
**Ciphering**: A numerical coincidence, involving the same set of digits (irrespective of order). Especially, such a connection between the two Net-Span digits of a demon and another binomic variable.
 
**Clicking**: Numerical matching (by exact (or ordered) ciphering). Cryptographic operation of a demonic Mesh-Number.
 
**Cluster-Type**: Decadology. One of the nine basic formulas of time, which group the Amphidemons and Cyclic Chronodemons. Each cluster-type corresponds to one of the nine non-zero numerals that compose the Decadence pack, each grouping four demons according to the twin binary distinctions of major/minor rites, and pitch polarity (corresponding to decadence suits).
 
**Conduit**: Numogram complication involving prime-ordinate zygonomy. The system of conduits is quasicomplementary to that of Gates (since it maps trends to involutionary arrival in the Time-Circuit, or incursions from the outside).
 
**Continuism**: Loose calendric reform movement - increasingly radicalized in a Y2K- positive direction - proposing the continuation of K-Time on a trinomic count.
 
**Crypt**: Dark-twin of the Net, characterized by intense K-Goth influence, A-Death inactivism, Cyberschiz tendencies, and Lemurian cultural affinities.

**Cthelll**: Earth's iron ocean, comprising one third of terrestrial mass, approximately three thousand km below the surface. Intensive megamolecule.
 
**Cthelllectronics**: Auto-engineering pragmatics of anorganic terrestrial intelligence, emergent from the ionic swirls of Cthelll, it intersects with the electromagnetic fields of the technostrata. According to the K-Goths, when the web switches to Cthelllectronics it calves-off into the Crypt.
 
**Cthulhu Club**: Beginning (in 1949) as a reading group dedicated to the hyperstitious reevaluation of Lovecraftian fiction, the Cthulhu Club was steadily drawn into Lemurian sorcery after recognizing Stillwell's model of the Numogram as the virtual source of Alhazred's Necronomicon.

**Cybergothic**: Dark-side web-underground subculture characterized by Y2K-positive time-schizophrenization, anti-Microsoft digital agitation, Micropause and Synatives abuse, Catajungle, and ameiotic libido. [See A-Death, Crypt, Cyberschiz].
 
**Cyberschiz**: Cyberspace disintegration. [See Calendric Secessionism, Crypt].
 
**Cyclic Chronodemon**: One of the twelve nonsyzygetic Chronodemons whose major and minor rites mutually encompasses the Time-Circuit. Although these demons together produce the fabric of ordered time, they may still generate various anomalous becomings amongst their secret rites. In post-Atlantean traditions they are associated with the houses of the zodiac, and (later) with the months of the year.

**Net-Span**: Demonic poles. The net-addresses between which a demon translocates.
 
**Nma**: (Or N'Ma). South-East Asian cultural matrix, reputedly originating in the civilization of Mu, and maintaining the practices of Lemurian demonism and time sorcery, until devastated by the 1883 explosion of Krakatau. The Nma were composed of true tribes (tripartite sub-groups): Mu, Dib, and Tak, linked by a triangular cyclic kinship system. The ancient cultures of the southern Chinese and of the Dravidians share many features with that of the Nma, suggesting a common source (or alternative principle of convergence).
