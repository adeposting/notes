## Notes

- **Retroflex sounds (zh, ch, sh, r)**: Require curling the tongue back, unlike English.
- **Nasal finals (an, en, ang, etc.)**: End with a nasalized sound (air through the nose).
- **Tones**: Critical in Chinese but not reflected here. Use tone marks for accuracy.

This list prioritizes **closest English approximations** while highlighting unique sounds. For precise pronunciation, practice with audio resources is recommended.
