### Chronological Timeline (In-Universe)

The _X-Men_ features a complex timeline with alternate realities and time travel. Here is a simplified chronological order:

- **1962**: _X-Men: First Class_
    
- **1973**: _X-Men: Days of Future Past_ (past scenes)
    
- **1983**: _X-Men: Apocalypse_
    
- **Late 1980s**: _Pryde of the X-Men_  An alternate-universe take with a retro-futuristic setting; best placed just before the 1990s as a standalone interpretation.
    
- **1992**: _X-Men: Dark Phoenix_
    
- **2000**: _X-Men_
    
- **2003**: _X2: X-Men United_
    
- **2006**: _X-Men: The Last Stand_
    
- **2011**: _Marvel Anime: Wolverine_  Set after Jean Grey's death (referenced), loosely fitting post-_The Last Stand_ in a divergent timeline.
    
- **2011**: _Marvel Anime: X-Men_  Set after the events of the Wolverine anime and also references Jean's death, likely fitting just afterward in the same alternate continuity.
    
- **2013**: _The Wolverine_
    
- **2023**: _Logan_ (alternate future)
    
- **2029**: _X-Men: Days of Future Past_ (original dystopian timeline)

**_Note_**: _Deadpool_, _Deadpool 2_, and _The New Mutants_ remain ambiguously placed due to their meta-narrative elements and unclear continuity. The anime and _Pryde of the X-Men_ are considered alternate universe entries rather than canonical to the main Fox X-Men timeline.
