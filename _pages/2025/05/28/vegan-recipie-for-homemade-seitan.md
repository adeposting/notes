So here's a recipe for homemade seitan I came up with based on a few I found on some cooking sites. Seitan is one of the highest if not *the* highest in protein out of any vegan foods. We're talking like 21 grams per serving here, no joke. It's also dirt cheap to make, so for a vegan on a tight budget homemade seitan is super economical. Which is saying something, given that seitan is *super* expensive at the grocery store. And this recipie makes a *lot*. I mean a *lot* a lot. Plus, you can store seitan in the refrigerator or even the freezer, and because doing it at home means it's made fresh, it lasts quite a while. I had to adapt this recipie to what I had on hand at the time (I was too poor and hungry to follow one of the ones I found online to the letter) but I think it worked out pretty good.

- Fry in a pan with a dash of oil and a little soy or teriyaki sauce.
- You can either season in the pan with sesame seeds or do it after plating.
