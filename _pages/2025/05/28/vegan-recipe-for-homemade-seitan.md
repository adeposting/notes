So here's a recipe for homemade seitan I came up with based on a few I found on some cooking sites. Seitan is one of the highest if not *the* highest in protein out of any vegan foods. We're talking like 21 grams per serving here, no joke. It's also dirt cheap to make, so for a vegan on a budget homemade seitan is super economical. Which is saying something, given that seitan is *super* expensive at the grocery store. And this recipe makes a *lot*. I mean a *lot*. Plus, you can store seitan in the refrigerator or even the freezer, and because doing it at home means it's made fresh, it lasts quite a while.

- Mix the broth ingredients in as much as possible.
- Bring to a slow boil

**8. Once the dough is ready, prepare the uncooked seitan.**

- Divide the dough into two parts.
- The two parts should not be flat, but be mini loaves.
- For each mini loaf, cut the dough into thin slices at most 1/2 inch thick.

**9. Cook the seitan for 30 minutes.**

- Wait for it to cool enough to handle.
- Cut into strips or small chunks.

**11. Fry the cooked seitan.**

- Store the cooking broth for later use in an airtight container in the refrigerator.
- Store any of the seitan you don't want to eat now with a bit of broth in an airtight container in the refrigerator (or with no broth in the freezer).
- Squeeze any remaining broth out of the seitan you want to use.
- Fry in a pan with a dash of oil and a little soy or teriyaki sauce.
- You can either season in the pan with sesame seeds or do it after plating.
